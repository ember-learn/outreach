# outreach

This repo is to keep track of issues related to 3rd party integrations and outreach for Ember. Although the Learning Team does not manage or create these third party resources, we can help bring together people who want to work on them!

Everyone in the community is invited to open issues, comment, participate, and lead projects tracked here. The Learning Team is available to help answer questions and provide guidance, but is otherwise focused on projects in the [Initiatives board](https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/19).
